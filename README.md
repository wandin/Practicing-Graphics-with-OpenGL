# Project Features

## Window Creation and Manipulation
- Created and manipulated windows to provide a user interface for the application.

## Mesh/Model Drawing
- Implemented mesh/model drawing functionality to display various objects within the application.

## Shader Usage
- Utilized shaders to apply various visual effects to objects within the scene.

## Uniforms
- Used uniforms to pass data from the application to shaders for dynamic rendering effects.

## GLM Transformation
